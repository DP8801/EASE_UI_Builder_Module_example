# EASE Python Script Generator

## Overview

The EASE Python Script Generator is a tool designed to streamline the development process when working with EASE system modules. The problem it addresses is the need to manually define each method of the system modules before importing them. This tool automates the creation of Python scripts with all necessary module methods pre-defined, saving developers time and effort.

## Problem Statement

When using any built-in module method of the EASE system modules, it is required to define the method in the format:

```python
def <functionname>(): pass
```

This definition must be placed before the module import statement:

```python
loadModule('/System/<sysmodulename>')
```

For each method to be used in the module, the method name must be defined as shown above. This repetitive task can be cumbersome and time-consuming.

## Solution

The EASE Python Script Generator overcomes this problem by allowing users to provide the path to create Python scripts, input the name of the `.py` file, and select the modules they might be using. The tool then creates the file with the required modules and all the methods of those modules already defined. This accelerates the development process and eliminates the discomfort of manually defining each method.

## Features

- **User Input**: Allows users to specify the path and name of the Python script file.
- **Module Selection**: Users can select the modules they intend to use.
- **Automated Method Definition**: Automatically defines all methods for the selected modules.
- **Ease of Use**: Simplifies the script creation process, making it more efficient and user-friendly.

## Usage

1. **Run the Script**: Execute the EASE Python Script Generator.
2. **Provide Path**: Enter the path where the Python script should be created.
3. **Enter File Name**: Input the desired name for the `.py` file.
4. **Select Modules**: Choose the modules you will be using in your script.
5. **Generate Script**: The tool will create the script with all necessary module methods pre-defined.

## Example

Here is an example of how the generated script might look:

```python
def clearConsole(): pass
def closeView(): pass
def convertSelection(): pass
# ... other method definitions ...

loadModule('/System/Build')
loadModule('/System/Environment')
# ... other module imports ...
```

## Benefits

- **Time-Saving**: Reduces the time spent on repetitive tasks.
- **Consistency**: Ensures consistent method definitions across scripts.
- **User-Friendly**: Simplifies the process of working with EASE system modules.

## Conclusion

The EASE Python Script Generator is a valuable tool for developers working with EASE system modules, providing a more efficient and streamlined approach to script creation.
